Hey there! I'm a Computer Science student at IIIT Kottayam who loves coding, designing, and exploring cool tech. I enjoy working on AI, web development, and building fun projects.

## What I Do
- Code in C++, Python, and JavaScript
- Build web apps with MERN Stack and Flask
- Solve coding problems (200+ on LeetCode!)
- Design stuff at BetaLabs

## Other Things I Enjoy
- Tweaking Linux and Neovim
- Being part of the mess committee (yes, really!)

Always learning, always building. Letâ€™s connect!
